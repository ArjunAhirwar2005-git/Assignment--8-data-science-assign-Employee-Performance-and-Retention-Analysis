# Employee Performance and Retention Analysis
## Assignment no. 8 final result and report file 
## Project Overview
This project analyzes employee data to predict performance scores and retention (attrition) trends using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables (Department, Attrition).
2. **EDA:** Used Pairplots, Heatmaps, and Boxplots to visualize relationships between Salary, Age, and Performance.
3. **Statistical Analysis:** Calculated probabilities using Bayes' Theorem and performed ANOVA hypothesis testing.
4. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - **Random Forest Classifier** for predicting Attrition.
   - **Linear Regression** for predicting Performance Scores.
5. **Deep Learning:** Implemented Neural Networks using TensorFlow/Keras for both regression and classification tasks.

## Key Findings
- **Attrition:** Employees with lower performance scores (< 3.0) showed a higher probability of leaving.
- **Departments:** ANOVA testing revealed significant differences in performance scores across different departments.
- **Model Performance:** The Random Forest model achieved high accuracy in predicting which employees are at risk of leaving.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-Learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
